# Hadoop and Spark on Docker

This tool sets up a Hadoop and Spark cluster within Docker containers on a **single machine**. The real cluster in Docker container outperforms the psudo-distributed Hadoop cluster on a single machine (which is nontrivial to run HA mode and launch multiple datanodes) and setting up a real QE cluster (which is complex and heavy). It's convenient for debugging and testing operations.
